        "1. In the implementation of the components, it is important that the forward and backward passes operate on the same data. Since the forward pass is **always** executed first, we store the necessary input data as class attributes during the forward pass. In this way, we ensure that the same data is accessed during the backward pass without any changes between the two passes. For instance, the input $x$ that is used in both the forward and backward pass of the Linear layer will be passed as an argument to the `forward()` method and stored as a class attribute (e.g. `self.x`) to be accessed in the `backward()` method. You will notice this practice repeated in the implementation of different components.\n",

The `backward()` method receives the argument `grad_output`, which represents the gradient of the loss with respect to this layer's output, coming from the next layer in the network.  You need to use `grad_output` in your calculations when computing the gradients of the loss. You can refer to the computational graph in Figure 1 to understand the flow of gradients through the network.\n",

        "1. **Matrix shapes:** Make sure that the shapes of your input, weights, and biases are compatible during the matrix multiplications.  You are expected to implement $y = W x + b$ for a **batch of inputs**. For a single input sample, _x_ is typically a column vector, but when dealing with multiple input samples, the input matrix will contain one row for each input sample. Pay attention to the shapes provided in the docstring of each method, and apply the transpose where necessary.\n",
        "2. **Backward pass gradients:** During the backward pass, you need to return only the gradient of the loss with respect to the input (`self.grad_input`). This is necessary because it will be passed to the preceding layers as part of the chain rule during backpropagation. However, you also need to compute `self.grad_weight` and `self.grad_bias`. These gradients will not be returned as they do not contribute to the chain rule for the coming layers, but they will be used internally during the parameter update."
